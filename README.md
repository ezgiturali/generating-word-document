In this study, real world data is anonymized. The content is completely different, but the structure is the same. It was a script I prepared for the backend of a work using UiPath.

There are two Excel datasets, Turkish and English. With Python, we understand which of these data sets are loaded and we get a Word file output according to the report formats in two different languages.

In this process, if we get any error, we create a log file to log this error. If we don't get an error, we get a notification that the process is error-free. 

Note that the data inside the "data" folder and the data outside the folder are different.
